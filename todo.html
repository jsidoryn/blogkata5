======== Questions ======== 

[ ] Why are my tests failing?
[ ] What is the correct method for creating new? See this: http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/submitting-forms-with-ember-data/6091
[ ] How do I show just the comments for the post I'm viewing from within comments?
[ ] How do I create a new comment and save the reference both to the parent post and the comment itself? Does Ember data do this for me?
[ ] Why can't I see relationships in Ember Inspector? What is the best way to see what's loaded?
[ ] General - what is the best way to find what I have available? Use $E? Go through the container? Use the debugger?
[ ] Sublime slowness when looking for files? Seems ok now though?
